        <!-- A SWF with a main timeline must have a class name to rename it to. Why does it have
             to be renamed? Well technically we could leave its name as-is and it would actually
             work ok. We force this because this name has a higher chance of collision. It's a
             good habit to get into to explicitely state what the name of the SWF's timeline
             should be. -->
