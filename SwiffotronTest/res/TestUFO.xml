  <!--
    Input:
    
    A UFO, piloted by a monocular martian. This is dangerous on two counts:
    
     - One-eyed martians have no depth perception, and are not legally safe
       to pilot inter-planetary light-speed vehicles.
     - It's dangerous to pilot such vehicles un-aided. All inter-planetary
       travel should be carried out with a minimum of 2 vehicles in convoy
       since chance recovery in the universal expanse of space is unlikely.
       
    Output:
    
    A minimal convoy of two interplanetary craft, both safely manned by
    pilots with full depth perception.
